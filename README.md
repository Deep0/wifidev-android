WifiDev [ROOT]
=====================

WifiDev is an Android application that lets you easily debug and test your Android apps wirelessly, using adb connect. This app automatically sets your phone's adbd port to 5555, instead of having to manually connect your phone to your computer via cable to set up the connection. All that's left is to issue the "adb connect" command from your computer!
