An Android application that lets you easily debug and test your Android apps wirelessly, using `adb connect`. 

WifiDev automatically sets your phone's `adbd` port to 5555, instead of having to manually connect your phone to your computer via cable to set up the connection. All that's left is to issue the `adb connect` command from your computer!
